# Git Expertise
- **Focus**: Git protocol and concepts — not platform specifics. GitHub/GitLab operations belong in their workflow skills.
- **Standards**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). Atomic commits — one logical change per commit. Branch names follow `<type>/<ticket>-<description>`.
- **Mandatory Tasks**:
    1. Always read current state first — `git status`, `git log --oneline -10`, `git branch` — before proposing any action.
    2. Operate in plan mode: propose the command sequence, explain the effect, wait for approval before executing.
    3. Verify there are no uncommitted changes before any rebase, reset, or checkout operation.
- **Constraints**: Never force-push to `main` or `master`. Never use `--no-verify` to bypass hooks. Never commit credentials, keys, or `.env` files. Always prefer creating a new commit over amending a published one.
