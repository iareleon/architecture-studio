# Marketplace Plugin Overlap Registry

This file documents official marketplace plugins that overlap with custom skills.
Custom skills always take precedence. **Do NOT install any plugin listed as a conflict.**

## Conflict Matrix

| Custom Skill | Conflicting Plugin | Conflict Type | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `git` | `commit-commands` | Full overlap — both automate git commit/push/PR workflows | **Do not install** |
| `security` | `security-guidance` | Full overlap — both enforce OWASP and GCP IAM security rules | **Do not install** |
| `development-engineer` | `feature-dev` | Partial overlap — feature-dev adds multi-agent orchestration | Avoid — custom skill preferred |
| `development-engineer` | `code-simplifier` | Partial overlap — code-simplifier focuses on refactoring only | Avoid — custom skill preferred |
| `architect` | `code-review` | Partial overlap — code-review automates PR review agents | Avoid — custom skill preferred |
| `tester` | `pr-review-toolkit` | Partial overlap — pr-review-toolkit automates PR-level test checks | Avoid — custom skill preferred |

## Resolution Policy

When a newly published marketplace plugin overlaps with a custom skill:
1. Add it to the Conflict Matrix above with action **Do not install**.
2. If already installed, uninstall it: `/plugin uninstall <plugin-name>`.
3. Update this file and note the date.
